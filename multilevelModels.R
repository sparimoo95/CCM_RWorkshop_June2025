# Import data -------------------------------------------------------------

# Linear regression -------------------------------------------------------

# let's look at the relationship between income and job satisfaction
# controlling for the National Student Satisfaction Rating (NSSRating)

# the significant effect means that the employees at a higher payscale report
# higher job satisfaction than the average job satisfaction of employees at lower payscales
###

# Random intercepts model -------------------------

# but each individual is nested within a department
# it is possible that employees in one department are systematically more satisfied
# with their job than employees in another department
# we can model this between-department variability using a random intercept for the department

random_int_model = lmer(jobsat ~ scale(income) + NSSrating + (1 | dept), data = job_sat_df)

# you can obtain the coefficients of your fixed effects and random effects together

# you can get the random and fixed effects coefficients separately

# plot fixed effects i.e., the average employee satisfaction within each payscale

# plot random effects i.e., the average employee satisfaction within each department
plot_model(random_int_model, type = "re") + theme_apa()

# you can see that the job satisfaction rating is generally lower in some departments (red)
# than in other departments (blue)

# you can plot each random intercept too

#
# Random slopes model -----------------------------------------------------

# it is possible for the relationship between payscale and job satisfaction to differ between departments
# e.g., what if, in one department, higher payscale is related to lower job satisfaction?
# we can model this using a random slope

# you can get the random and fixed effects coefficients separately

ranef(random_slope_model) # random slope for each level of the fixed effect, per department


# plot fixed effects i.e., the average employee satisfaction within each payscale 
plot_model(random_slope_model, type = "pred", terms = "income") + theme_apa() 

# plot random effects i.e., the average employee satisfaction within each department
plot_model(random_slope_model, type = "re", ci.lvl = 0.95, se = TRUE) + theme_apa()

# plot each random slope

                         NSSrating = mean(job_sat_df$NSSrating, na.rm = TRUE))
